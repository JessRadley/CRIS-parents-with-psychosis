# CRIS-parents-with-psychosis
R code used to clean data from CRIS and then analysis a project which looked at how many parents there were in a sample with psychosis and what characteristics were associated with being a parent.

#Cleaning data entry sondaug
Once child details had been found through reading clinical notes and written into an excel sheet, the file was to check that there were no errors e.g. that those parents who were marked '0' for 'Evidence of child' had no child details reported in subsequent columns. A function was written to report whether children were over or under 18 when looking at their ages.

#Cleaning patient characteristics
Once all the child details had been found through reading clinical notes and this was cleaned, patient (parent) characteristics were downloaded from CRIS. The main point of this file is to collapse characteristics into smaller categories.
